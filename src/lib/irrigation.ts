/**
 * The irrigation engine — how much water this field needs, when, and why.
 *
 * Pure and isomorphic: no DB, no `next/headers`, no fetch. Same contract as
 * `agronomy.ts`, so the dashboard can call it on the server and a client
 * component can recompute from the same inputs without a round trip.
 *
 * ── What this computes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A FAO-56 soil water balance. The field is treated as a reservoir the crop
 * draws down and rain or irrigation refills:
 *
 *     TAW  = AWC × rootDepth        total available water in the root zone, mm
 *     RAW  = p × TAW                 readily available — the refill trigger
 *     ETc  = ET₀ × Kc(stage)         what the crop takes out today, mm
 *     Peff = effective rainfall      what the sky puts back, mm
 *     Dr   = Dr₋₁ − Peff − Irrig + ETc        depletion, clamped to 0..TAW
 *
 * When `Dr` reaches `RAW` the crop is about to start losing yield, so that is
 * when to irrigate — and the amount is `Dr` itself, because refilling past
 * field capacity just drains below the roots.
 *
 * ── Why physics and not a model ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every number here can be traced to a measured input: Open-Meteo's
 * Penman-Monteith ET₀, the crop's Kc from FAO-56, the soil's water-holding
 * capacity, the method's application efficiency. That matters more than
 * sophistication — a farmer who is told to run a pump for three hours deserves
 * an answer that can be checked, and an LLM asked to produce millimetres will
 * produce plausible ones whether or not they are right. The language model in
 * this feature writes sentences about these numbers; it never produces them.
 *
 * ── Honesty about inputs ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The weakest link is where the balance STARTS. Without a season of history we
 * do not know today's depletion, so `source` on the result always says which of
 * three footings was used — a live sensor, modelled from the last known wetting
 * event, or a mid-range assumption. The UI shows it. See `npk.ts` for the same
 * convention applied to un-measured nutrient levels.

  // The baseline is the habit this feature exists to replace: irrigate on a
  // fixed calendar, refill the whole root zone, ignore the forecast. Over a
  // 7-day window that is one full refill.
  //
  // ── Why this is gated ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  // An earlier version compared the baseline against whatever the plan
  // scheduled, which meant a week where the soil simply had not dried to the
  // refill point yet reported "100% saved". That is not a saving, it is a
  // deferral — the crop will want that water next week, and claiming it as
  // banked would be exactly the kind of invented number `npk.ts` exists to
  // prevent. So a saving is only reported when we can point at what produced
  // it: an irrigation that ran smaller than a full refill, or one the rain
  // forecast let us skip outright.
  //
  // Nothing here is metered. The number compares two schedules on the same
  // week's weather; it does not measure anyone's pump, and it carries that
  // sentence wherever it is shown.
  //
  // ── Why the baseline differs by system ────────────────────────────────
  // "Refill the whole root zone once a week" is the habit of someone running
  // a surface system, and comparing a drip plan against it flatters drip
  // enormously — a single 15 mm top-up against a 110 mm flood reads as "85%
  // saved", which says more about the comparison than about the farmer.
  // A timer-driven drip user's actual habit is a fixed daily dose that
  // ignores the forecast, so that is what drip is measured against.
